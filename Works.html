            <h4>He made breakfast</h4>
            <p>He was meaning to spend all day in bed, but a friend of his told him he should eat something, he rejected her proposal at first, but after some pestering he gave in.
                 He thought about making some proper breakfast, but it seemed like too much effort and seeing it was already past noon he couldn't be bothered, so he settled with pouring milk onto a bowl of cereal and be done with it. 
                 He knew it wasn't much, but to him it was still an acomplishment worth telling about.</p>

                <h4>He drew a dog</h4>
                <p>At one day he wanted to prove to himself that he can do something if he puts real effort into it, so he decided to draw a dog. At the end he didn't finish it, instead he left it half done so it would always remind him how much potentional is wasted by him never finishing anything, knowing with just a little more effort he could make something of value. Unfortunately It didn't help him knowing it didn't motivate him, it only made him feel worse.</p>
